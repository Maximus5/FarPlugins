This simple plugin may be used to decode something encoded with base64 algorithm.

It may be called from editor, select text like


    Subject: =?utf-8?B?UkU6INCi0LXRgdGC?=

choose "base64 decoder" in the F11 menu and plugin will try
to convert that to the user-friendly string if it is possible :)

Also, plugin can hook "enter into archive" (Enter & CtrlPgDn), it will show "<HostFile>.bin".
User may view it or copy to the passive panel (F5), no confirmations.
